# MatchingGame
This project was a homework due for the Trilogy & University of Arizona Coding Bootcamp. This project was intended to hone my skills in
 * React
 * CSS
 * Javascript
 * jQuery
 * JSX
 * Node
 * Heroku

The homework for this project instructed me to construct a clicky memory game.
 1. The game consists of a set of pictures different from each other.
 2. To play the game, the user must click every picture once in each round.
    * If a user clicks on the same image twice, the game resets to level 1, scores are resetted and high score is kept.
 3. Once a user wins a round, new and larger sets of pictures will appear.
 4. After a user wins a round, scores and levels are updated.
